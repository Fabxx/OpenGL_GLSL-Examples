# OpenGL_GLSL-Examples
Made for personal study

NOTE: The examples are made from this base: https://ogldev.org
Reworked with glm libraries and GLFW instead of FreeGLUT and odlev math 3D library.

I just reorganized the code to make it more readable.

# I want to try these examples, how do i compile them?

  -Get the required depencies/libraries described in the guide
  
  -go into the folder where the makefile is
  
  -type make and the project will compile.
