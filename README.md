# OpenGL_GLSL-Examples
Made for personal study.

# I want to follow these examples to learn, what are the basic requirements?
-C/C++ Understanding
-Linear Algebra (vectors, matrixes mostly)
-Patience and will into experimenting.

These Examples were based off on ogldev.org tutorials, but re-adapted to use glm libraries and GLFW instead of FreeGLUT.
